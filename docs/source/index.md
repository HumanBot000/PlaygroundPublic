## First we need to add the bot to your server.

 - Go To the [Invite Bot Page](https://playground.mlserv.xyz/add/)
 - You should be brought to our [Top.gg Page](https://top.gg/bot/1063461122553942077) that looks something like this.
- ![Top.gg](https://ibb.co/hcMMgb1)
- ![Click Accept](https://ibb.co/vZpVdZH)
- ![Click invite](https://ibb.co/jzTCdfh)
- ![You Should get to a page like this,choose the right server and submit](https://ibb.co/qL6521d)
- Check the permissions, to use all features, all these permissions are needed.
But if you don't feel confident giving some permissions, you could just disable them. Playground would notify you if some permissions are needed for certain features
![You will have the best experience with all boxes anabled.](https://ibb.co/pR5TWcL)

- Now you can close the tab and continue in discord.
